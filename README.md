# Sum-of-Numbers

<h1>Sum of Numbers</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project was to use list capabilities to accept values from the user and provide
the sum of the entered list. I actually found this one a little difficult. The multiple do-while loops in the requirements actually made this more complicated than it needed to be.
I get that those types of requirements aren't always up to you as the creator. For instance, there might be a larger program plugin that requires you to use methods
other than one you might normally use, so I do get the real-world tie-in. It was kind of a backwards challenge to make the code less concise and felt a little weird.
My preferred build (I had to change it to meet requirements) used functions to break up the individual components and streamline the user interaction.
